# simushell
Simulation of a Linux-like shell for Linux with filesystem access

# Starting the program
You have to run the program (for the time being) with either `dotnet run` in the source directory or run a release, with all files around it, by running `dotnet SimuShell.dll` or `mono SimuShell.dll`.

# Windows?
No.
Due to the difference in directory structures, it would be tough to focus on supporting to operating systems at the same time, so we only support Linux for the time being.

# macOS?
Give me a tester, and sure, I could try (afaik the Linux/Unix and macOS have the same sort of layout, with drives and such)
